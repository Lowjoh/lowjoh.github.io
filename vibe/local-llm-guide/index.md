# Running LLMs Locally for Privacy and Control

![Home AI Assistant](/local-llm-guide/assets/home-ai-assistant.jpg)

> *"The most significant opportunity for individuals in the AI era is to build personal AI systems that are fully controlled by the user, aligned with their values, and deeply integrated with their digital life."*

## About This Guide

This comprehensive guide explores the motivations, architecture, ecosystem, and feasibility of running large language models (LLMs) locally for personal use. As AI capabilities continue to advance, the ability to host these powerful systems in your own environment offers unprecedented privacy, control, and personalization.

Whether you're a privacy advocate, a tech enthusiast, or simply curious about building your own AI assistant that truly serves your interests alone, this guide will walk you through the why, what, and how of local LLM deployment.
